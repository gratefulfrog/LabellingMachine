# The Great Labelling Machine
This repo contains code for:
* The GLM Simulator/Visualization:
 * The same code can either simulate the full physical machine or simply receive and 
   display the state of the physical machine.
* The GLM Machine code:
 * Arduino code to run the machine and communicate with the visualization.
